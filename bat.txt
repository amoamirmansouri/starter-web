If you’ve ever been caught in the crush of a New York City crowd, 
you may not have thought to thank the subways.
Without that massive transportation system whizzing beneath the 
pavement, the streets of the most populous city in the US would be not 
just packed, but utterly gridlocked. The subway has been relieving foot 
and vehicle traffic since 1904, and in 2015 alone provided 1.76 billion 
rides. And while we commonly consider a subway system to be primarily 
underground, about 40 percent of New York City’s tracks run on or above 
street level, especially outside of the densely built-up borough of 
Manhattan.

The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system in the New York City 
boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. It is owned by 
the government of New York City and leased to the New York City Transit 
Authority, an affiliate agency of the state-run Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority (MTA). Opened
